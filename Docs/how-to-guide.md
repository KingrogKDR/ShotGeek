## 1. How to Find a Player Page  
To find a specific player’s page:  
- Enter the **full name** of the player into the search bar.  
- Avoid entering only a first name or making typos, as this may lead to incorrect results or an error page.  

**Example**:  
To find Charles Barkley's page, enter `"Charles Barkley"` into the search bar.

- You can view the player’s **career stat totals**.  
- For deeper analysis, scroll to the bottom of the page:  
  - Use the dropdown menu to view detailed **tables** for various statistics.
